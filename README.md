# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-EDA-

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (2023)**.
The project focuses on identifying patterns in fraudulent vs legitimate transactions using Python.

**Workflow**
1. Data Quality Check (missing values, duplicates, outliers)
2. Class Distribution (legitimate vs fraud)
3. Transaction Amount Analysis
4. Correlation Heatmap
5. Feature vs Class Visualization (boxplots, histograms)
6. Simple Rule-Based Fraud Detection

**Key Insights**
1. Fraudulent transactions are extremely rare compared to legitimate ones.
2. Fraud cases often involve higher transaction amounts.
3. Several features show clear separation between fraud and legit classes.
4. Rule-based detection can catch some fraud but is insufficient alone.

**Tech Stack**
Python (Google Colab)
Libraries: **Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib**

**Conclusion**
This project highlights how EDA techniques can reveal fraud patterns in financial transactions.
It serves as a foundation for further work, such as applying machine learning models for real-world fraud detection.
